Chat server with same games eventually:

You'll need nodejs installed, then run these commands in the root folder:

> npm install --save express@4.15.2
>
> npm install --save socket.io

After that's done, just run this to get the server started:

> node index.js

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you're gravy.
